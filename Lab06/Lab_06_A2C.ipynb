        "## Implementation\n",
        "Since this algorithm relies on updating a function for each existing pair of state and action, environments that have a high state-space become problematic. This is because we can approximate better the actual value of a state-action pair as we visit it more often. However, if we have many states or many actions to take, we distribute our visits among more pairs and it takes much longer to converge to the actual true values. The CartPole environment gives us the position of the cart, its velocity, the angle of the pole and the velocity at the tip of the pole as descriptors of the state. However, all of these are continuous variables. To be able to solve this problem, we need to discretize these states since otherwise, it would take forever to get values for each of the possible combinations of each state, despite them being bounded. The solution is to group several values of each of the variables into the same “bucket” and treat them as similar states. The agent implemented for this problem uses 3, 3, 6, and 6 buckets respectively."
